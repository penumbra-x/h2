## Features

* Client and server HTTP/2 implementation.
* Implements the full HTTP/2 specification.
* Passes [h2spec](https://github.com/summerwind/h2spec).
* Focus on performance and correctness.
* Built on [Tokio](https://tokio.rs).

## Non-goals

This package focuses solely on implementing the HTTP/2 specification. It supports client-side processing based on the original [h2](https://github.com/hyperium/h2) branch, including:

* Headers frame priority and pseudo-header permutation
* Priority frame (client-side only)

For additional features, consider using [hyper2](https://github.com/0x676e67/hyper2), which builds on this package.

## Accolades

The project is based on a fork of [h2](https://github.com/hyperium/h2).
